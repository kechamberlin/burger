# burger

This app allows a user to create a burger and add it to an existing schema table.

To start, the user will need to run npm init and npm i, and then run "node server.js"

Next, the user will go to localhost:3000, from which the user can view 3 pre-made burgers that have not been devoured.

If the user clicks "devour," the burger targeted burger will move to the "devoured" section; conversely, if the user clicks "uneaten," the burger will move to the "uneaten" section.

Additionally, a user can add a burger to the table, and decide if it is uneaten or devoured.

Enjoy, and happy eating!
